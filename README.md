# One script, more jobs.
Welcome, to the ever-growing script hub called rlxl. 
We aim to make one script be thousands in one. We are growing and we need your help.

























# Distributor ID
The most secure way to confirm fake scripts, a "DistID" will be like this "TAG/IDENTIFIER :: Collab_Authnum"
This feature will soon be able to go to other scripts, and help them with BLATANT copies, although the system is simple.



# Error codes
Oh yes, error codes. The list goes on of 
how many there are. A list of the ones in rlxl are below.
### Code 410
The DistID was incorrect or terminated.
### Code 425
Rlxl is being updated during your session
### Code 204
No script
